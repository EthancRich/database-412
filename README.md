## Introduction
This project is an app for managing tech devices at an ASU Lab.

## Notes on getting the install to work
Python version requirements: Python 3.8 - Python 3.11

You need psycopg2
`pip3 install psycopg2-binary`

I had errors with it, but found this article that fixed the issue:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5420789/how-to-install-psycopg2-with-pip-on-python
installed libpq-dev with the correct python version and it was all good

Install streamlit
`pip install streamlit`

## Running the Program
In the repository folder, run the following command:
`streamlit run 1_Home.py`
